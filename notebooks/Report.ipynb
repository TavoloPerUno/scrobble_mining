    "* On the other hand, a Britney Spears duet with Don Phillip scored high in terms of Familiarity but very low in Hotness. This result is intuitive as Britney Spears is one of the most recognizable artists worldwide -- however, few listeners are interested in her lone track with writer Don Phillip (I Will Still Love You)\n",
